# South Park Project

[<b>Live demo</b>](https://jovial-muffin-170336.netlify.app/1)

Project created to practice multiple aspects of TypeScript and interfaces/types. The website uses Axios to fetch data from the South Park API and displays information about the characters and about the episodes of the series. I learnt about different components and their aspects with TypeScript.

Tech used:
<ul>
<li>TypeScript</li>
<li>React (useContext, useEffect, useState)</li>
<li>Vanilla JavaScript</li>
<li>React Router</li>
<li>Axios</li>
<li>South Park API</li>

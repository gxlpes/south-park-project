# South Park Project

<b>Live demo:</b>

Project created to practice my skills with TypeScript and their coding methods/aspects. This project itself fetches data using Axios from the South Park API and it displays in a list. The project is simple and it uses React (ContextAPI) + React Router under the hood.

Tech used:
<ul>
  <li>TypeScript</li>
  <li>React (useContext, useEffect, useState)</li>
  <li>React Router</li>
  <li>Axios</li>
  <li>South Park API</li>
 </ul>
